## Introducing, <em>isymtope</em>

### One template language for client and server

Design your app once and only once.

### Redux-ified

Specify your stores and action right in the template, we will generate the Javascript for you, automatically.

### Api's included.

Define your API's in our template language or import grpc.io, protobuf, swagger and more. We will generate the Redux actions that you can consumer in your application.

Export API's for your databases using <a href="https://diesel.rs" target="_blank">diesel.rs</a>.

### Make free calls!

Calls to your api's are free when rendering server-side if they are in the same process, and the exact same syntax is used.

### No (server-side) Javascript

This framework is pure Rust and can even by compiled into a native binary. You don't need Node.js running on your server.
